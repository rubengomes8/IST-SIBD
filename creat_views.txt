• Create views over the tables in the database model, corresponding to the
following relational schema.


dim_date(date_timestamp,day,month,year)
RI: date_timestamp corresponds to a date existing in consults

create view dim_date as 
	(select date_timestamp, day(date_timestamp), month(date_timestamp), year (date_timestamp) from consult;


dim_animal(animal_name,animal_vat,species,age)
animal_name,animal_vat: FK(animal)

create view dim_animal as 
	(select animal.name, animal.VAT, animal.species_name, animal.age from animal)

facts_consults(name,vat,timestamp,num_procedures,num_medications)
name,vat: FK(dim_animal)
timestamp: FK(dim_date)

create view facts_consults as
	(select dim_animal.animal__name, dim_animal.animal_vat, time(consult.date_timestamp), count(keydasprocedures), count(keydas medications) 
	from dim_animal (acabar isto depois)


Present the SQL code for creating each of the views corresponding to
the tables in the previous model, so that the views list the corresponding
records in the database (i.e., information on all the animals that had
consults, together with the associated number of procedures and number
of prescribed medications).
